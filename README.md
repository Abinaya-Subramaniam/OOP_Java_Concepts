This repository contains examples of fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in Java. Each concept is demonstrated in a separate Java program for clarity and ease of understanding.

Folder Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
.
├── EncapsulationDemo.java
├── InheritanceDemo.java
├── PolymorphismDemo.java
├── AbstractionDemo.java

**OOP Concepts Covered**
Encapsulation
Demonstrates how to restrict access to an object's data using getters and setters.
File: Encapsulation.java

Inheritance
Shows how a class can inherit properties and methods from another class.
File: Inheritance.java

Polymorphism
Explains how the same method can behave differently depending on the object.
File: Polymorphism.java

Abstraction
Illustrates how abstract classes are used to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses.
File: Abstraction.java

Interface
Demonstrates how interfaces define contracts that classes must adhere to.
File: Interface.java

**How to Run**

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/oop-concepts-java.git

Navigate to the project folder:
cd oop-concepts-java

Compile and run any file:
javac <Filename>.java
java <Filename>
Replace <Filename> with the name of the file you want to run (without the .java extension).

**Prerequisites**
JDK installed on your machine.
Basic knowledge of Java and object-oriented programming.
