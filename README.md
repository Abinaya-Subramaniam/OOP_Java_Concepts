This repository contains examples of fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in Java. Each concept is demonstrated in a separate Java program for clarity and ease of understanding.

**OOP Concepts Covered**
Encapsulation
Demonstrates how to restrict access to an object's data using getters and setters.
File: Encapsulation.java

Inheritance
Shows how a class can inherit properties and methods from another class.
File: Inheritance.java

Polymorphism
Explains how the same method can behave differently depending on the object.
File: Polymorphism.java

Abstraction
Illustrates how abstract classes are used to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses.
File: Abstraction.java

Interface
Demonstrates how interfaces define contracts that classes must adhere to.
File: Interface.java
